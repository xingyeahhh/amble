### abstract
Humans are not designed to live sedentary lives in overcrowded urban environments, which is reflected in the deteriorating mental state of the species. The objective of this project is to  build an application which supports Manhattan residents seeking to improve their mental health. Despite the widespread availability of wellness, mapping and exercise applications, no solutions combine these three aspects, allowing users to build journey’s through quiet, green and safe spaces. At its core, \textit{amble} is a route-generating application featuring an algorithm capable of filling this void. The application includes complimentary features such as an AI-powered chatbot offering suggestions to improve routes, a rating system feedback loop designed to improve future performance, and mental health related resources specific to your \textit{amble's}. The machine learning model which predicts busyness based on forecasted weather is trained using data from Yellow Taxi, Citi Bike, and OpenWeather, together with NYPD crime statistics. The mean average error of the Yellow Taxi and Citi Bike prediction models were 0.1258 and 0.2882, respectively; this ratio determines data set weighting when calculating the busyness score. The project employed a ‘fail fast’ methodology, seeking user feedback as early as possible ultimately resulting in additional features such as heatmaps to illustrate the algorithm's effectiveness.
