Summary of Node Selection based on user preferences.

1. park_locations.json = basedata (approx 380 nodes)

2. park_node_locations.json added to base data (approx another 320 nodes). base data is always present

3. userpref.jsx (from front end) produces a file = preferences.json

4. this file is used to produce a nodes_final.json file.  if all other nodes are chosen = approx 2,500 nodes


In addition there is a separate script (create_allnodes_to_db.py )that produces 

5. a file all_nodes.json - with all the 2,500 nodes (whether they were selected by user or not)

6. This data is sent to our database should anyone want to access data from the db

7.  There is no functionality at present for doing this (but the data is there)

Apart form park_locations.json and park_node_locations.json, the other node json files are:
  "library_locations",
  "community_locations",
  "museum_art_locations",
  "worship_locations",
  "walking_node_locations",
